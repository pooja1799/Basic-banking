# Basic-banking
I have created a simple dynamic website which has the following specs. 
Started with creating a dummy data in database for upto 10 customers. Database used: Mysql
Customers table will have basic fields such as name, email, current balance.
Transfers table will record all transfers happened
Flow: Home Page > View all Customers > Select and View one Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to > View all Customers
No Login Page. No User Creation. Only transfer of money between multiple users. 
This project is done for internship on web designing for The Spark Foundation
